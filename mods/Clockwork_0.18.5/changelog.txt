Version: 0.18.3
  Changes:
    - Compatibility support for Krastorio 2: Accumulator changes have been moved to later in the data lifecycle to ensure Krastorio2's accumulators are modified, if the respective Clockwork setting is active.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.4
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where pitch black night wouldn't work with endless night mode (the surface won't respond to darkness changes at certain phases, so the code that set darkness was moved up to execute sooner). FOR AN EXISTING SAVE: If you experienced this bug, please turn off the "pitch black" setting, then turn it back on and you should be OK.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.3
  Changes:
    - Due to recent controversies around licensing within the Factorio modding community, I'm now explicitly including the license text with the mod download. Note that, as the license was listed on the mod webpage from the beginning, this license applies to all versions of his mod. Now, however, it is packaged with the files too.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.2
  Changes:
    - Multisurface mode no longer enabled by default - just to err on the side of caution with mod compatibility.
    - There is now an option to disable nightvision, for those that really want to emphasize lights.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug where pitch black night setting wouldn't turn off.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.1
  Changes:
    - Requires Factorio 0.18.1. 0.18.0 will no longer work.
    - Updated to use Factorio's new brightness system. Granular changes are no longer possible. You will need to update your Clockwork settings in game.
    - Multi Surface support added. This may help Clockwork work with mods that add planets and similar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.18.0
  Changes:
    - Update for Factorio 0.18.
    - Known issue: Brightness setting no longer works. Factorio devs have accepted this as a bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.4
  Changes:
    - Added the ability to change the minimum brightness level. Simply, you can make nights even darker and scarier now.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.3
  Changes:
    - Increased the maximum day/night multiplier and accumulator multiplier settings to 1000, for you crazy people that want a factorio day to be 24 real hours or longer. Did some testing to ensure these values will work, at least until someone makes a Terajoule accumulator (Don't worry, even bob mod's biggest accumulators don't come close).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.2
  Changes:
    - Added a setting to control the time of day a game starts at. Default is "0.0" or noon, but if you adjust the dusk/evening/morning/dawn thresholds, you may wish to change this.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.17.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Additional safety checks in case another mod touches surface day/night settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
