[technology-description]
mox-fuel=Use plutonium from reprocessed waste to create new fuel cells.
nuclear-rocket-fuel=Adding fissile material to rocket fuel makes it more powerful... somehow.
plutonium-breeding=Breeder cells burn faster but yield large amounts of plutonium when reprocessed.
nuclear-fuel-reprocessing=Reprocess used nuclear fuel to recover uranium-238 and plutonium.
