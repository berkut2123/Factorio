---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.55
  Changes:
    - Recycling machine can be crafted normally (not only be space manufactory).

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that some techs hand science packs as ingredients that were not tech prerequisites (progression is unaffected, the tech tree is just clearer).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.54
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that a debug print line was left in a released version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.53
  Changes:
    - Biomechanical resistance data and bio combustion resistance data require experimental specimens not significant specimens.

    - Fixed cargo rocket launch trigger green signal when rocket cargo full not working.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.51
  Changes:
    - Player cannot craft lifesupport recipes anymore (many of them required fluid and weren't hand craftable anyway).

  Bugfixes:
    - Set fuel refinery to require stone bricks not concrete.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.50
  Changes:
    - When a cargo rocket silo is deconstructed items are generated for the space capsule and rocket sections that were consumed. Rocket fuel is still lost, but can be pumped out first.
    - Added corpse markers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Added 6 tiers (4 new tiers) of Energy shield equipment. Energy shields charge quickly but are power hungry. Higher tier versions will be difficult to use effectively until the personal antimatter reactor equipment is added.

  Changes:
    - Code changes required to have hr graphics in a separate mod that is not a required mod.
    - Added cargo rocket silo launch event thanks to MFerrari.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Fixed a problem with spaceship launch sequence when integrity stress exceeded maximum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.42
  Features:
    - Added Antimatter Reactors. Antimatter can be manufactured where there is abundant energy (like a star), and used to power somewhere energy poor (like deep space).
    - Added Fluid Burner Generators. Can burn fluid with an energy value to generate electricity. Simple and compact but lacks the energy efficiency of steam setups. Allows spaceships to burn rocket fuel for power.

  Changes:
    - Renamed supercomputer MK2 and MK3 to Quantum supercomputer and Neural supercomputer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.41
  Changes:
    - There are now 4 tiers of medpack.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.40
  Changes:
    - Meteors that fall in water don't leave remnants.

  Locale:
    - Added string for se-core-miner-drill

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.39

    - Added missing unlock for bio combustion data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.38
  Changes:
    - Changed planet core mining to use a different method that does not require continuous updates via script. They are now like electric mining drills and output in the same way. You may need to remove inserters and add belts to collect the fragments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.37
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed meteor point defence being unplaceable in space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Added custom meteor event sound.
    - Added a custom alert for meteors so it does not make the annoying sound that happens when something gets printed to the console.
    - Added a per-player setting for meteor alerts to be printed to the console (so you can look back later to see stats, but you get the annoying noise), off by default.

  Changes:
    - Space science is now required on average 1 tech later in many tech lines.
    - Rocket silo research is now cheaper and faster.
    - Meteor defence installation accuracy reduced to 80%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.33
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved the on/off flicker of space science labs but it is still not perfect. The graphics still need to be redone to remove the flicker completely, but the graphics need to be updated anyway to remove the pipes.
    - Fixed that cargo pods couldn't be placed in space, and therefore would be destroyed by the game engine if the tile under them was changed while in space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.32
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed supercomputer in SR using HR graphics that got cut off.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.29
  Info:
    - IMPORTANT: Compatibility patches and a few other things are being moved to a separate mod (space-exploration-postprocess). It is required, but I can't list it as a dependency. Please make sure you install it when updating (assuming you read changelogs).
    - Moved all graphics to a separate package (also required but I can list it as a dependency without causing a dependency loop). This is to allow people to download code updates without repeatedly downloading 200MB of images.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Scripting:
    - Updated remote interface: begin_meteor_shower. Can now specify number of data.meteors along with data.entity or (data.zone_name and data.position)
    - Added remote interface: get_zone_from_name requires data.zone_name
    - Added remote interface: get_zone_from_surface_index requires data.surface_index
