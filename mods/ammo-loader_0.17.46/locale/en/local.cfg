[technology-description]
ammo-loader-tech-loader-chest=Through innovative weapon design and careful logistical coordination, you have discovered ways to make ammunitions distribution much easier.
ammo-loader-tech-requester-chest=A modification to the Loader Chests has allowed you to incorporate a logistic interface into the design. Due to space limitations, only a single interface could be installed.
ammo-loader-tech-vehicles=By preemptively placing supply caches and planning expeditions accordingly, you can now supply yourself with ammo and fuel on the go.
ammo-loader-tech-burners=After much effort, you have discovered that the existing Munitions distribution system can be expanded to supply combustion fuel as well.
ammo-loader-tech-artillery=With the aid of advanced logistics research, you have discovered how the Loader Chests can be used to supply Artillery turrets and wagons.
ammo-loader-tech-upgrade=Prioritization and organization of existing supply depots now makes it possible to automatically upgrade Ammunition in existing outposts.
ammo-loader-tech-return-items=Unlocking the munition supply lines to run in both directions has allowed easy restocking of supplies in obsolete outposts.

[mod-setting-description]
ammo_loader_enabled=Uncheck to disable the mod temporarily.
ammo_loader_draw_range=When enabled, draw range perimeter when hovering over chest. Disable if the game lags when selecting Loader Chests.
ammo_loader_debugging=Print debugging info to console
ammo_loader_upgrade_ammo=When enabled, turrets filled with weaker ammo will attempt to return their items and upgrade when better ammo becomes available.
ammo_loader_fill_artillery=When enabled, Ammo Loader Chest will fill artillery turrets and wagons.
ammo_loader_fill_locomotives=When enabled, Fuel Loader Chest will fill locomotives with fuel.
ammo_loader_fill_burner_structures=When enabled, Fuel Loader Chest will also fill burner structures (except boiler).
ammo_loader_bypass_research=Enable this to make Loader Chests available without research.
ammo_loader_max_items_per_inventory=Maximum number of items in each tracked inventory. If an inventory already has this number or more combined items in its inventory, it will be ignored. Use to limit how much Ammo Loader will use per inventory. 0 = infinte.
ammo_loader_ticks_between_cycles=Ticks to wait before each processing cycle. Raising this will improve performance at the cost of throughput. Requires loading savegame to take effect.
