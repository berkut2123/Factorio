# Angel's Extended - Remelting
## Little Molten Metal overhaul.
It's now viable to set up your logistic network using only pipes with molten metals instead of plates. Alloy Mixer can create alloys using molten metals instead of ingots, the rest can be handled by Casting Machine and Strand Casting Machine.
And if you have an excess of metal plates, just remelt them back!

## Options:
* Smooth Angel's Smelting Integration
_Use Angel's Smelting technologies for remelting discovery instead of using external technologies based on Metallurgy._
When enabled, if a metal has ``Advanced %METAL% Smelting 2`` technology, it will be unlocked by it. If not, it will be unlocked by ``Advanced %METAL% Smelting 1``.
When disabled, it will offer ``Advanced Metal Remelting X`` technologies for unlocking plate remelting.
