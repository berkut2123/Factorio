## Introduction

*Have you ever looked at your factory and thought: "I dunno, but what this planet is seriously missing is a decent four-lane highway network."
Then worry not: This mod was made to help fulfilling your infrastructure dreams.*


**Asphalt Roads**

"Asphalt Roads" adds a new tile set with a smooth, black road surface to your games, including tiles for hazard marking and lane marking. Enjoy the reduced vehicle friction modifier and accelerate up to 200 km/h with your car (using rocket fuel). 

- Mark separate lanes on your roads with single or double lines
- Mark hazard areas in various colours e.g. near railway crossings or gates 
- Set up pedestrian crossings with zebra crossing or "shark teeth" tiles

- **Double line tiles** are another variation of lane marking tiles

### Technology
Basic technology is called **Asphalt** and needs concrete as a prerequisite.

### Mod recommendation and support 

Recommended mods that work well in addition to this one:

- [Pavement Drive Assist](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Arcitos/PavementDriveAssist): Allows player driven vehicles to detect lane marking and follow your roads

- [Concrete Signpost](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Klonan/Concrete_Lamppost) (by Klonan) adds sign posts that look really nice in addition to asphalt roads

- [Dectorio](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/PantherX/Dectorio) (by PantherX): This mod adds pretty traffic bollards (and a bunch of other neat stuff)

Supported mods

- [Bio Industries](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/TheSAguy/Bio_Industries): If present, crushed stone will be used as an ingredient for asphalt (replacing stone). This can be disabled in mod settings tab.

- [Wood Gasification](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Wood_Gasification): If present, tar will be used as an ingredient for asphalt (replacing crude oil). This can be disabled in mod settings tab.

### Effects on gameplay

This mod is mostly non-game-changing, apart from the reduced vehicle friction of asphalt. But this is compensated by the significant amount of crude and heavy oil needed for the production of asphalt. For more fun, i recommend the heavy use of blueprints!

### Current language support

- EN (English)
- DE (German)
- CN (Chinese)

## Known issues

**"I'm using 'Asphalt Roads' along with 'Alien Biomes' and other mods and are constantly getting errors about missing tiles"**

Factorio's limit for the number of different tile prototypes a game can use at a time is hard-coded. **Currently this limit is 255 tiles**. If you load multiple mods that add a lot of new tiles (like "Alien Biomes" and "Dectorio"), this might be a problem, as "Asphalt Roads" allone needs 65 free tile slots to work properly (assuming all tiles being enabled).

If you experience problems, please try disabling some of the markings in Asphalt roads' mod options. Disabling both double line road line markings, for example, will free up 24 slots. If other mods allow disabling some of their tiles, please consider using those options, too.

Unfortunately, the Factorio devs do not consider raising this limit in the foreseeable future, so a bit of tinkering is unavoidable.
