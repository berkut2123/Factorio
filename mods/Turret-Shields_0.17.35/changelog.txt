0.xx.35

0.16.29
- Fixed a crash when initializing an attacking flamethrower-turret.
- Increased damage resistances of shield combinators
- Updated korean localization by Xagros

0.16.26
- Better compatibility to other mods
- Fix for research being unavailable, but it might show up if you have deactivated it.
(No clue what mod is causing it, I have never experienced that issue.)

0.16.25
- Combinators now also disable a selected amount of neighboring towers

0.16.24
- Added a combinator to let you switch shields off automatically

0.16.23
- Added a selection tool for disabling / enabling shields to save energy
- Added a setting to change how much energy (percentage of maximum shield points) is consumed every second to keep the shields active

0.16.21
- Added energy consumption
When idle, the shields draw power equal to 0.1% of their maximum hitpoints per second.
If there's not enough power to satisfy this need, the shields will collapse quickly.
The setting for the energy consumption multiplier can be found under "startup settings".
Obviously recharging your whole base can hit your energy balance pretty hard.
If you can't handle it, use the cheat "ts refresh"

0.16.20
- Added support for multiple surfaces and teams

0.16.19
- Improved research icons
- Some people reported that they had to deactivate and reactivate research to make it appear. This should be fixed now.
If you encounter any problems, you (player[1]) can enter "ts refresh" to refresh everything.
(but please create a bug report anyway)

0.16.13
- Optimized textures for low graphics settings

If you were researching one of the technologies before 0.16.12, the game won't display the current progress but is still researching (but it might have resetted the progress). you can check the progress by switching to another technology and switching back.

0.16.12
- Reduced research cost
- Added an alternate animated shield effect.
